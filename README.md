### Hey there!

I'm Nathan and I spend a lot of time working with computers.

I am currently a _computer science and engineering_ senior planning to graduate in the spring of 2021.

__What is a CSE degree?__ It's a fusion bachelor of science in computer science and computer engineering. This means that I have a larger scope of knowledge concerning both hardware and software compared to either of those degrees on their own. Hopefully that means I can bring some understanding to problems on either side.

__I'm interested in__ development across the board: whether it's as high-level and cosmetic as UI/UX or as low-level and baremetal as desiging a microcomputer, I should be able to bring some insight and experience to the table.

__Open-source software__ is of particular interest to me, and I would love to get involved with your project if it fits my skillset.

__Some languages I've used to build projects__ are Python, C++, Go, Java, C#, C, assembly (68k and MIPS), VHDL, and HTML/CSS with a hint of Javascript.

If you're interested in working with me or simply learning more about me or my qualifications, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-tompkins-396957180).
