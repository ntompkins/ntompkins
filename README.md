### Hey there!

I'm Nathan and I spend a lot of time working with computers.

__I currently work in__ hardware programming and embedded systems. 

__I'm interested in__ development across both hardware and software: whether it's as high-level and cosmetic as UI/UX or as low-level and bare-metal as designing a microcomputer, my goal is to bring insight and experience to the table.

__Open-source software__ is of particular interest to me, and I would love to get involved with your project if it fits my skillset.

__Some languages I've used to build projects__ are Python, C++, Go, Rust, Java, C#, C, assembly (68k and MIPS), VHDL, and HTML/CSS with a hint of Javascript.

If you're interested in working with me or simply learning more about me or my qualifications, please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-tompkins-396957180).
