hey there, i'm nathan.

most of my time is spent working on/with/for computers.
currently, i earn money programming hardware, debugging
kernels, and automating embedded systems.

i'm constantly trying to learn more about c, bash, vim,
git, debian, python, go, servers, linux, and computers
in general.

most of my projects are not hosted on github.
