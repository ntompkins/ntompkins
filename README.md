hey there, i'm nate.

i spend most of my time working on, with,
and for computers. i earn money programming
hardware, debugging kernels, and automating
embedded systems.

day to day, i try to learn more about good
software by digging into things like c, git,
(neo)vim, the linux kernel, go, python, self
hosting servers, and good design practices
in general---wherever they might show up.

most of my work is not hosted on github.
